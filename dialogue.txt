Simple dialogue is a basic, clear conversation between two or more people, often used in learning English or storytelling, focusing on everyday topics with straightforward language, short sentences, common expressions like greetings (How are you?), and easy-to-understand exchanges, presented in formats like scripts with character names or using quotation marks for direct speech.
